                                This modernist cliff-side villa was built in 1971 and sits alone inside a coastal National Park on the southern tip of Japan's stunning Izu Peninsula. The glass-fronted home and deck were designed to maximize the open views of the Pacific Ocean.

- Authentic example of Japanese modernist architecture.
- Close to famous beaches, hiking trails, hot springs and temples.
- No other buildings within view.
- Natural setting, total privacy.
- West-facing for stunning sunsets.
- Best views in Izu.
The space
Izu Cliff House was built by two married Tokyo University professors in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Their vision was for a tranquil vacation home made of glass and placed atop a cliff, offering endless views of the Pacific ocean and the volcanic topography of the Izu coast.

Today, the surrounding area is a first grade National Park, meaning it's illegal to build any new structures nearby — the house sits alone on the natural cliff face.

Our favorite thing about Izu Cliff House: sitting up in bed, moments after waking up and looking out to see the Pacific Ocean, open sky, islands, seabirds and natural forest.

Our second-favorite thing about Izu Cliff House: BBQ'ing on the deck all afternoon with friends.

The surrounding property is rather large (albeit on a steep, forested hillside), but the house is compact — about 70 square meters of open, lofted space. We tend to spend a lot of time eating and relaxing out on the large deck, which is about 33 square meters and looks directly down over the Ocean.

There is a traditional Japanese room on the upper floor, featuring tatami mat flooring and sliding shoji paper doors. One of the shoji walls folds from the ceiling to complete the effect of a traditional Japanese room/cozy sleeping chamber. For a group of more than two, extra Japanese futons and linen bedding are provided for laying out in the open space of the upstairs loft.

The first floor features a large daybed, built by a local carpentry master from camphor wood. As much as possible, we have tried to source the home's furnishings and accessories from regional craftsmen. The large mirror frame and hinoki cypress stools were also carved by hand by craftsmen.

The kitchen is compact but highly efficient, with commercial fittings and nice accessories. You will have everything you need to prepare great meals from the fresh regional produce and seafood available in the area.

The bathroom is similarly compact but newly remodeled in a contemporary style.
Other things to note
We offer additional vacation equipment for rent, including snorkeling gear, beach chairs, and a BBQ. Please enquire when you book!

A few things to bear in mind to fully enjoy Izu Cliff House: It's quite remote, not particularly kids-friendly (it is literally on a cliff - be advised!), and it sits within a natural forest, so please be ready for some insects during peak summer (spray and mosquito coils provided, but can't hurt to bring more of your own). The house also is over 40 years old, so it's more about vintage Japanese minimalist living than contemporary luxury. This is a place more for those seeking authenticity than 5-star luxury.
