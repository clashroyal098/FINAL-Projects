                <div class="about">Dan Eggers loved to run. In the 29 years our family had the privilege of knowing and loving Dan, few things were as consistent as Dan running…and paddle boarding…and biking…and landing a perfectly-timed one-liner.

                    When Dan set off on a run on July 26th, 2024, a normal day was underway in North Falmouth where Dan enjoyed spending summers. However, during his run Dan suffered a devastating cardiac event. A number of miracles brought him to Falmouth Hospital and then to Brigham and Women’s Hospital and, with Erin by his side, Dan fought for his life for more than 2 weeks.
                    
                    On Sunday, August 11th, 2024, Dan passed away from the damage that ravaged the extraordinary heart and mind of someone we all loved dearly.
                    
                    Dan loved nothing more than his family. He was the perfect match for Erin. In fact, their junior prom may be the longest first date in history, and they’ve loved and cared for each other ever since. Dan was an extraordinary father, mentor, and friend to Luke (17), Meghan (14), and Brendan (11). He was a source of strength and a tireless helper to his mother, Nancy Eggers, especially after the passing of his father, Thomas Eggers. He was an unfailingly devoted brother to each of his siblings, Tom, Peter, Christopher, and Caitlin, and spoke of them often as if referring to friends (of which he also had many!). Dan will be missed tremendously by his extended family, especially the nieces and nephews who could always count on him for an adventure and advice.
                    
                    Dan’s legacy of loyalty, commitment to education, and love of the people and the world around him lives on through his children. Like their parents, each of the children aspire to higher education and we would like to provide an opportunity to contribute to Luke, Meghan, and Brendan’s education beyond high school.
                    
                    If you would like to support Dan’s memorial fund, please see the information below. All donations will be kept in a qualified education account to be shared among the Eggers children.
                    
                    Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved Dan, Erin and their family. We will miss our brother and hope that the pain each of us feels will be lessened by our memories and faith that we will see Dan again.
                    
                    With love and sadness,
                    Tracey and Jane
